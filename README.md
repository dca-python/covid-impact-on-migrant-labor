My thesis scrutinized the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic and related policy responses had on labor market outcomes of a range of migrant groups in Germany. Ultimately, the aim was to answer the question of whether there were significant, unexplained differences in the magnitude of employment shocks for different migrant groups compared to native Germans.
